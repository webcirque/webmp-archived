1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
Although each of the world's countries
即使世界上每个国家

2
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,620
would like to dispute this fact,
对这个事实存有争议，

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,120
we French know the truth:
我们fa♂国人知道真相：

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,520
The best food in the world
is made in France.
世界上最好的食物由法国制作

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,620
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,220
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,720
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,520
booked five months in advance.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,320
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,720
has made his competitors envious.

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,120
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,420
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,620
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,020
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,020
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,820
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,420
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,320
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,620
This is me.

20
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,420
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
What's my problem?

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,120
First of all, I'm a rat.

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,720
Which means life is hard.

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,320
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,320
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,120
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,620
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,320
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,420
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,820
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

32
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,320
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

33
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,620
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,620
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

36
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,620
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
until Dad gave me a job.

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,920
Clean.

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
Clean.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
That's right. Poison checker.

41
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,920
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,720
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,020
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,920
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,520
Well, it made my dad proud.

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,220
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,920
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,620
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,320
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,420
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,020
This much I knew:

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,020
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,720
But to my dad...

56
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,920
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,620
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,320
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,920
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,920
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,620
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,220
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,220
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,520
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,420
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
but there's something about them.

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,020
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,520
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,120
How can I describe it?

70
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,720
There is excellence all around you.

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,420
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,520
Oh, Gusteau was right.

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh, mmm, yeah.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
Oh, amazing.

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,220
Each flavor was totally unique.

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,520
But combine one flavor with another,

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,320
and something new was created.

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,520
So now I had a secret life.

80
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,020
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,520
Hey, Emile. Emile.

82
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
I found a mushroom.

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,220
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,820
He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,620
Why are you walking like that?

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.

87
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
that we handle food with?

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,320
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?

90
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,520
All the time.

91
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,120
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,420
Well, go ahead.

93
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,120
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,220
What have you got there?

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Ah, oh, oh...

96
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,620
You found cheese?

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de ch鑦re de pays!

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,220
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,220
And...

100
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
This rosemary! This rosemary

101
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,420
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'II... You know...

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,420
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

104
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,220
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,820
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,020
Emile!

107
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,020
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

108
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,620
We got to cook this.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

110
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah.

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,320
The key is to keep turning it.

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,820
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,320
That storm's getting closer.

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,320
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

115
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,620
You got to taste this!

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,020
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,020
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

118
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,120
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

119
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,420
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,120
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,920
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

122
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,520
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

123
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,120
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

124
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,120
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,220
Saffron.
- Not good.

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,820
Saffron.

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

128
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,320
I've been down here a million times.

129
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,520
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,620
You've been here a million times?

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

132
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,420
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

133
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,720
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

134
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,720
Wait. You read?

135
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,620
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,320
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

137
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,520
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't like secrets.

139
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,020
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

140
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,420
while we read and cook.

141
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,620
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

142
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,220
Why do I let you?

143
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,920
What's taking those kids so long?

144
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

145
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,820
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,620
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.

147
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,220
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,720
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

149
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,820
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

150
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,520
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.

151
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
You must try things that may not work.

152
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,920
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

153
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,120
because of where you come from.

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Your only limit is your soul.

155
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,620
What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
Pure poetry.

157
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
But it was not to last.

158
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,120
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars

159
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,820
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.

160
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,520
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,720
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,

162
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,920
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,520
Gusteau is dead?

164
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh!

165
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,220
Oh! Oh!

166
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,420
Oh!

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,920
Run!

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,620
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

169
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,320
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,620
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

171
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,320
Try to grab you.

172
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,620
Emile, swing to me.

173
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

174
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,720
Let me through!
- The book.

175
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,320
Let me through!
- The book.

176
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,820
Excuse me. Move, move.

177
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,320
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

178
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,120
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

179
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,220
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

180
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,920
Push off. Come on.

181
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,120
Get hold!

182
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,820
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

183
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,420
Hey, wait for me!

184
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,520
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

185
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,120
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

186
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,020
I'm coming!

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

188
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

189
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,120
Come on. Reach for it.

190
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,320
You can do it.

191
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,920
- Remy!
- Dad!

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,820
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

193
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,720
Guys, wait. Stop!

194
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,920
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

195
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,720
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

196
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Dad?

197
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,620
Dad?

198
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,020
Which way?

199
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
I waited

200
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,820
for a sound,

201
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,720
a voice,

202
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,520
a sign,

203
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,420
something.

204
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,020
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

205
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why do you wait and mope?

206
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,020
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

207
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,720
probably forever.

208
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,820
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

209
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,220
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

210
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,120
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are Ionely.

211
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,420
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

212
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,920
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

213
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,720
If you focus on what you've left behind,

214
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,220
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

215
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,520
Now go up and look around.

216
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,220
Oh!

217
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,820
Champagne!

218
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,320
What are you doing?

219
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,620
I'm hungry.

220
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,220
I don't know where I am,

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,020
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

222
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

223
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,820
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

224
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,220
But I am hungry.

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,520
Food will come, Remy.

226
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,220
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

227
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,620
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

228
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,120
Paris?

229
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,220
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

230
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,520
Wow.

231
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,020
It's beautiful.

232
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,820
The most beautiful.

233
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,720
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

234
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,220
You've led me to your restaurant.

235
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,520
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,020
I got to see this.

237
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,220
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

238
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,020
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

239
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,820
I need
more soup bowls, please.

240
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,520
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

241
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,920
I need two salmon, three
salade compos閑, and three filet.

242
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,920
Three orders
of salade compos閑 working.

243
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,720
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

244
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,220
Three filet working. I need plates.

245
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,120
Fire seven.
Three salade compos閑 up.

246
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,120
Don't mess with my mise!

247
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,520
Open down low.

248
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm getting buried here.

249
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,420
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

250
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

251
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,120
- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.

252
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,120
Hey, boss, look who is here.

253
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,620
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

254
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

255
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,920
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

256
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,420
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

257
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,720
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

258
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,620
- My mother?
- Renata.

259
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,620
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

260
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,320
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

261
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,620
She died.

262
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,420
Oh.

263
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,620
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

265
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,320
You know, afterlife-wise?

266
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,220
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

267
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,820
I think she hoped it would help me,

268
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,320
you know, get a job here.

269
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,020
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

270
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,220
Any son of Renata's is more than...

271
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

272
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,120
We have already hired him.

273
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,920
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

274
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,820
We needed a garbage boy.

275
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,920
Oh, garbage. Well...

276
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,820
I'm glad it worked out.

277
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,320
Uh...

278
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,020
I can't believe it.

279
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,420
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

280
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,720
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

281
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,520
Which one is the chef?

282
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh! Uh...

283
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,320
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

284
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,020
Who is next in command?

285
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,920
The sous chef. There.

286
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,120
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

287
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,820
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

288
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,120
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

289
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,020
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

290
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,320
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

291
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh, him? He's nobody.

292
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,320
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

293
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,220
No, he's a plongeur or something.

294
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,820
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

295
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,220
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

296
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
How do you know?
What do I always say?

297
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,220
Anyone can cook.

298
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

299
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,920
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

300
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,420
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

301
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,820
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

302
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,920
It's your restaurant. Do something.

303
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,220
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

304
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,520
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

305
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,220
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

306
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,420
Table five coming up,
right now.

307
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,620
Coming down the line.
Set.

308
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,420
Ah!

309
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Hot! Open oven!

310
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,720
Ah!

311
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,020
Coming around.

312
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,220
Ooh!

313
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,020
Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

314
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,220
Fire those souffl閟
for table six, ja.

315
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,320
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

316
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

317
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,720
It has a wonderful finish.

318
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,020
Ooh!
- Ah!

319
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,320
Hmm.

320
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

321
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,720
Oui, chef.

322
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,320
Remy! What are you waiting for?

323
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,320
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

324
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,020
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

325
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,320
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

326
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,020
Move it, garbage boy!

327
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,320
You are cooking?

328
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,020
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

329
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Where do you get the gall

330
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,920
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?

331
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
I should have you drawn
and quartered!

332
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,220
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

333
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,820
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

334
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,120
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

335
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,320
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

336
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,920
Soup?

337
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,220
Stop that soup!

338
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,220
No!

339
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,720
Waiter.

340
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
Linguini!

341
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,320
You're fired!

342
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,420
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!

343
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,820
She wants to see the chef.

344
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,020
But he...

345
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,320
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

346
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,520
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.

347
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,720
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

348
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,520
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

349
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,220
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

350
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,720
Someone is asking about your soup.

351
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,420
What are you playing at?

352
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,120
Am I still fired?

353
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,320
You can't fire him.
- What?

354
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,720
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

355
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,120
If she write a review to that effect

356
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...

357
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,520
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

358
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,820
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau

359
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,120
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?

360
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,120
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?

361
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
Anyone can cook.

362
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,820
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.

363
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,420
He has taken a bold risk

364
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,920
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.

365
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,320
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,

366
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,820
who are we to deny him?

367
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,320
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,520
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

369
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,020
you shall be responsible for it.

370
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,620
Anyone else?

371
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,420
Then back to work.

372
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,720
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.

373
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,320
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

374
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,320
Very close attention.

375
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,020
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

376
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,620
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...

377
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,120
Rat!

378
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,120
- Rat!
Get the rat.

379
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

380
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,020
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

381
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,620
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

382
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,320
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

383
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,020
Do you know what would happen to us

384
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?

385
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,320
They'd close us down.

386
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,820
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.

387
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,020
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

388
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,320
Whoa!

389
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Doh!

390
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,520
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

391
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,720
They expect me to cook it again!

392
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,720
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

393
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,020
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

394
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,120
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!

395
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,120
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

396
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,920
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

397
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,920
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

398
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,320
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...

399
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,720
I need this job. I've lost so many.

400
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,220
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

401
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,720
Did you nod?

402
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,920
Have you been nodding?

403
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,120
You understand me?

404
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320
So I'm not crazy!

405
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,620
Wait a second, wait a second.

406
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,420
I can't cook, can I?

407
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,120
But you...

408
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,620
You can, right?

409
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,320
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

410
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,820
Whatever you did, they liked it.

411
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,020
Yeah. This could work.

412
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,120
Hey, they liked the soup!

413
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,620
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

414
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,720
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

415
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,620
But we're together on this. Right?

416
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,820
Okay.

417
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,020
So this is it.

418
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,420
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...

419
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,920
Not much.

420
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,720
It could be worse.

421
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,220
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.

422
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

423
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,120
Are you...

424
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,520
Is this a dream?

425
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,920
The best kind of dream.

426
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,520
One we can share.

427
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
But why here?

428
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,420
Why now?

429
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,020
Why not here?

430
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,020
Why not now?

431
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,920
What better place to dream
than in Paris?

432
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,320
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

433
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,020
Oh, no.

434
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,320
Idiot! I knew this would happen!

435
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,220
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!

436
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,520
Eggs, gone!

437
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,020
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

438
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,620
That's what I get for trusting a...

439
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,020
Hi. Is that for me?

440
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,920
Mmm!

441
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,720
That's good. What did you put in this?

442
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,320
Where'd you get that?

443
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,220
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

444
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,920
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

445
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,220
Come on, Little Chef!

446
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,320
"Though I, like many other critic,

447
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,720
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

448
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,420
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

449
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!

450
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,120
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

451
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,020
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

452
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,220
Well...

453
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,320
You know.

454
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,520
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

455
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,120
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

456
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,820
So let's do this thing!

457
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,120
I...

458
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,020
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

459
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,020
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

460
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,820
Soup.

461
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,620
You little...

462
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,920
Ow!

463
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,820
You son of a...

464
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,520
You got...

465
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,020
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

466
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.

467
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,220
We've got to figure out something else.

468
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,520
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,

469
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,320
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.

470
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,120
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

471
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,420
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

472
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,820
Little Chef?

473
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,720
Oh, you're hungry.

474
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,520
Okay. So let's think this out.

475
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,120
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear

476
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
human.

477
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,920
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want

478
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,120
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

479
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,320
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

480
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,420
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

481
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,320
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

482
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
We gotta communicate.

483
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,720
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

484
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
The rat! I saw it!

485
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,820
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

486
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,620
What are you doing in here?

487
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,820
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

488
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,220
Get out.

489
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,220
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!

490
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,020
That was close. Are you okay up there?

491
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,720
Whoa!

492
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,920
How did you do that?

493
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,420
That's strangely involuntary!

494
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,520
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.

495
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,020
Okay.

496
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,320
Huh?

497
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,420
Where are you taking me? Wait.

498
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,120
Whoa!

499
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,920
Wait. I'm sorry.

500
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,620
Whoa!

501
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,720
Okay.

502
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
Mmm-hmm...

503
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Okay.

504
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,620
Whoa!

505
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,120
Whoa!

506
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,920
?votre sant?

507
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,120
All right.

508
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,320
That should do it.

509
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,020
Mmm.

510
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

511
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,920
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

512
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,520
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

513
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,020
Listen, I just want you to know

514
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,920
how honored I am
to be studying under such...

515
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,420
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

516
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,920
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?

517
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,320
Well, I...

518
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,820
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

519
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,120
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy

520
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,920
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.

521
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,420
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

522
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,820
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

523
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,520
Because, well, because you...

524
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,820
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.

525
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,520
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here

526
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,620
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

527
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,920
Got it?

528
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Wow!

529
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,520
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

530
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
Chine-easy.

531
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,320
- Excellent work, Fran鏾is, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

532
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,720
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

533
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,020
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

534
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,720
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

535
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,020
What are corn dogs?

536
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,220
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

537
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,520
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

538
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,920
Whip something up.

539
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,620
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.

540
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,920
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

541
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,920
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

542
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,720
Get my lawyer!

543
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,720
Well, the will stipulates

544
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,620
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death

545
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,020
no heir appears,

546
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,420
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

547
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
I know what the will stipulates.

548
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,820
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

549
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,020
There's not much resemblance.

550
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,620
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

551
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,920
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

552
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,320
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!

553
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,620
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter

554
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,620
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

555
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,220
Highly suspect!

556
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,220
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,920
- May I?
- Of course.

558
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,420
But the boy does not know.

559
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,920
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

560
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,020
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

561
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,020
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

562
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,620
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

563
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,720
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

564
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,620
Find out how much of this is real.

565
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,320
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples

566
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,120
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

567
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,620
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

568
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,620
He knows something.

569
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,820
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

570
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,320
What are you doing?

571
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

572
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,220
No! You waste energy and time!

573
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

574
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,520
Well, Mommy never had to face

575
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,220
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,

576
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,820
and every dish is different
and none are simple,

577
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,220
and all of the different cooking times,

578
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,520
but must arrive on the customer's table

579
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,720
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!

580
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,520
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!

581
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,320
What is this? Keep your station clear!

582
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,120
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?

583
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,720
Messy stations slow things down.

584
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,120
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

585
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,920
I'll make this easy to remember.

586
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,520
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!

587
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,920
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.

588
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,720
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

589
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,920
Always return to this position.

590
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,620
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

591
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,620
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

592
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,320
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

593
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,220
I know the Gusteau style cold.

594
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,620
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

595
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,620
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

596
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,520
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

597
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,020
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

598
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,420
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

599
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,520
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

600
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,020
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?

601
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,320
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.

602
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,320
Listen.

603
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,320
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

604
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,620
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

605
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,620
and there are only two way
to get first pick.

606
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,520
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

607
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,420
Voil? The best restaurant get first pick.

608
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

609
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,520
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

610
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,120
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.

611
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,720
And then he get fired

612
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,620
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.

613
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,420
Horst has done time.

614
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
LINGUINl: What for?

615
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,020
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

616
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,020
I defrauded a major corporation.

617
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,620
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

618
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,320
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.

619
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,120
I killed a man with this thumb.

620
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.

621
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,920
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.

622
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,520
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

623
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,620
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

624
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,220
So you see.

625
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,720
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

626
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,220
- We?
- Oui. You are one of us now, oui?

627
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,020
Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.

628
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,820
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

629
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,520
For taking it.

630
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,520
Huh?

631
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,520
The rat!

632
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,720
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

633
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,320
Have you decided this evening?

634
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,420
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

635
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,120
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

636
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,320
I know about the foie gras.

637
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,220
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.

638
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,420
What does the chef have that's new?

639
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,020
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

640
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
Yes. What do I tell them?

641
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,920
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

642
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,320
What are you blathering about?

643
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,520
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

644
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,120
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

645
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,020
This is simple.

646
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,220
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

647
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,020
something we haven't made
in a while...

648
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,920
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

649
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,620
They are asking for food from Linguini?

650
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,520
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

651
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,120
Were we saying that?

652
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,920
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

653
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,620
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

654
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,820
Something definitely off menu.

655
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,820
Oh, and don't forget to stress

656
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,420
- its Linguini-ness.
- Oui, chef.

657
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,620
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

658
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,020
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread ?la Gusteau.

659
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,820
- Colette will help you.
- Oui, chef.

660
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,720
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

661
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,620
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

662
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,520
Gusteau himself said so.

663
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,920
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.

664
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,620
"Sweetbread ?la Gusteau.

665
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,220
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust

666
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,320
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose pur閑,

667
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,920
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

668
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,820
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

669
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,220
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...

670
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,920
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

671
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,020
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

672
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,320
Veal stomach?

673
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,820
Oh!

674
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,020
Okay.

675
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,420
I'll be right back. Where...

676
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,720
Hey, I got to... Hey!

677
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,120
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

678
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,420
Let's see, over here...

679
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,720
I'll be back.

680
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,020
Thank you.

681
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,320
Excuse me. I'm going to...

682
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,020
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

683
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,820
I'm going to pick that up.

684
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,120
I got some of that spice.

685
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,220
Okay.

686
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,620
What are you doing? You're supposed

687
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,020
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

688
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,420
This is the recipe.

689
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,620
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!

690
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,220
What else have you...
You are improvising?

691
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,820
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

692
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,120
You're right. I should listen to you!

693
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,420
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

694
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,120
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

695
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,220
Where is the special order?
- Coming!

696
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,620
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

697
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,420
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

698
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,820
- The special?
- Come get it!

699
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,520
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

700
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,920
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

701
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,220
Sorry.

702
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,720
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

703
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,820
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.

704
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,520
- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.

705
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,420
Good. What? How could he change it?

706
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,620
He changed it
as it was going out the door!

707
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Ow!

708
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,820
They love it!

709
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,620
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.

710
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,520
I have seven more orders!

711
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,220
That's wonderful.

712
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,020
I'd like one of those.

713
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,120
Special order!

714
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,920
What is that?

715
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,320
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

716
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,120
To Linguini.

717
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,820
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?

718
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Drink now, there's plenty.

719
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,020
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

720
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,120
We really did it tonight.

721
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,320
Dah!

722
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,620
Got your toque!

723
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,020
Oh, seriously now.

724
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,820
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

725
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,620
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

726
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,520
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

727
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,620
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?

728
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,420
He's gotten all he needs.

729
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,120
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

730
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,120
Good for you.

731
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,220
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

732
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,420
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

733
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,720
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

734
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,820
not to appreciate
this '61 Ch鈚eau Latour.

735
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,120
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.

736
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,920
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

737
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,620
- Remy!
- Emile?

738
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,920
I can't believe it! You're alive!

739
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,520
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

740
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.

741
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,820
And what are you eating?

742
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,520
I don't really know.

743
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,820
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.

744
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,620
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

745
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,220
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.

746
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,120
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

747
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,420
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

748
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,720
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

749
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,620
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

750
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,320
So, where did you train, Linguini?

751
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,720
Train? All right.

752
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,420
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

753
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,820
- It's not.
- I knew it!

754
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,720
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

755
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,420
Monday was my first time.

756
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,320
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

757
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,620
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

758
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,020
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

759
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,120
Do you like animals?

760
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,920
What?
Animals? What kind?

761
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,620
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,

762
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,820
rats.

763
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,420
I brought you something to...

764
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,620
No, no, no, no!

765
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,520
Spit that out right now!

766
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:03,677
- Don't just work it down!
- Too late.

767
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:05,177
Here.

768
00:55:05,477 --> 00:55:09,877
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

769
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:14,377
- See?
- Not really.

770
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,777
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.

771
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,877
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

772
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:24,077
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

773
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:29,577
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

774
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:33,277
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

775
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:35,477
Okay.

776
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:39,377
I think I'm getting
a little something there.

777
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:41,577
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

778
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:43,377
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

779
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:45,377
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world

780
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:47,377
being combined
into infinite combinations.

781
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,577
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

782
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:52,077
I think...

783
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,777
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

784
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:57,277
But that was interesting.

785
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:00,177
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

786
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,677
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

787
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:04,077
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

788
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:05,677
- Yeah! But...
- What?

789
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:08,777
Thing is, I kind of have to...

790
00:56:09,277 --> 00:56:11,277
What do you "have to"
more than family?

791
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:12,677
What's more important here?

792
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:14,377
Well, I...

793
00:56:15,877 --> 00:56:17,877
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

794
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:19,777
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

795
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,777
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

796
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:23,377
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?

797
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:25,077
Nopety nopety no.

798
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,877
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

799
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:31,277
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

800
00:56:31,377 --> 00:56:33,777
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

801
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:37,977
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

802
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:39,677
If you're going to name a food,

803
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:42,677
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.

804
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:48,077
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

805
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:52,377
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

806
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:59,777
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

807
00:57:02,677 --> 00:57:04,577
My son has returned!

808
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:34,077
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

809
00:57:34,177 --> 00:57:38,077
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

810
00:57:38,277 --> 00:57:42,677
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

811
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:46,277
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.

812
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:49,477
Yeah, well, about that...

813
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,377
You look thin. Why is that?

814
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:54,977
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?

815
00:57:57,677 --> 00:58:00,677
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?

816
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,877
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

817
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:06,577
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

818
00:58:06,677 --> 00:58:10,577
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

819
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:14,177
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...

820
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:17,077
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

821
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:22,177
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

822
00:58:22,277 --> 00:58:24,877
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?

823
00:58:24,977 --> 00:58:27,177
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.

824
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:29,577
We're not birds. We're rats.

825
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:32,577
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

826
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:35,677
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

827
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:36,877
Maybe that's a good thing.

828
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:39,377
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

829
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:41,677
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

830
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:44,277
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

831
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:46,477
I want to add something to this world.

832
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:49,677
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

833
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,477
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

834
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:56,277
I've been able to
observe them

835
00:58:56,377 --> 00:58:59,277
at a close-ish sort of range.

836
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:01,677
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

837
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:05,377
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.

838
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,877
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

839
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:13,877
You know, I'm going to stay here.

840
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:18,177
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

841
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:21,377
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

842
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:23,477
Is that a problem?

843
00:59:23,677 --> 00:59:27,177
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

844
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:35,977
We're here.

845
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,577
Take a good long look, Remy.

846
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:51,377
Now, this is what happens

847
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:55,077
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.

848
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:59,477
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.

849
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:02,877
We must live carefully.

850
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:07,077
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

851
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:11,177
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.

852
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:18,377
- No.
- What?

853
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:25,377
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

854
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:28,577
Can only be more of this?

855
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:33,977
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

856
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:39,377
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

857
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:42,977
And it starts when we decide.

858
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:47,877
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

859
01:01:11,777 --> 01:01:13,077
Hey! Yeah.

860
01:02:11,177 --> 01:02:12,377
Stop it.

861
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:47,977
Good morning.

862
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:51,677
Good morning.

863
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:57,177
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?

864
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,877
That's big.

865
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:01,777
That's big. What did he say?

866
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:07,277
What?

867
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:09,877
What, you can't tell me?

868
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:11,777
Oh!

869
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:16,577
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

870
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:18,077
Oh, I see how it is.

871
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:20,777
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks

872
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:23,677
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?

873
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:25,277
Wake up. Wake up.

874
01:03:26,577 --> 01:03:29,377
I thought you were different.

875
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:33,077
I thought you thought I was different.

876
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:34,877
I thought...

877
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:40,077
I didn't have to help you!

878
01:03:40,177 --> 01:03:43,577
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

879
01:03:43,677 --> 01:03:44,777
But...

880
01:03:45,677 --> 01:03:50,277
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

881
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:53,577
My mistake.

882
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:57,577
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

883
01:03:57,777 --> 01:04:00,677
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

884
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:04,777
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

885
01:04:04,877 --> 01:04:08,177
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

886
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,077
At least not without your help.

887
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:13,577
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

888
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:17,777
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

889
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,977
When I added that extra ingredient

890
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:22,977
instead of following the recipe
like you said,

891
01:04:23,077 --> 01:04:25,277
that wasn't me either.

892
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:28,277
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

893
01:04:28,377 --> 01:04:30,177
I would've followed the recipe.

894
01:04:30,277 --> 01:04:31,677
I would've followed your advice.

895
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:33,577
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.

896
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:37,877
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

897
01:04:37,977 --> 01:04:39,577
But I...

898
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:41,277
Don't do it.

899
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,677
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

900
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:49,977
- I have a...
- What? You...

901
01:04:50,077 --> 01:04:54,277
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

902
01:04:54,377 --> 01:04:59,677
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

903
01:04:59,877 --> 01:05:00,977
Little...

904
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:04,277
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.

905
01:05:04,377 --> 01:05:06,377
A tiny chef?

906
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:08,977
Yes. Yes. He's...

907
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:13,977
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

908
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:19,377
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

909
01:05:20,577 --> 01:05:24,477
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

910
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:29,377
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

911
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,677
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?

912
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:33,877
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?

913
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:36,677
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

914
01:05:40,277 --> 01:05:41,377
No! No!

915
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:29,177
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

916
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,177
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

917
01:06:32,277 --> 01:06:35,377
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

918
01:06:35,477 --> 01:06:37,977
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?

919
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,977
What? What? Spit it out.

920
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:43,477
It's come back. It's popular.

921
01:06:47,777 --> 01:06:51,377
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

922
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:52,577
My last review condemned it

923
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,277
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

924
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:58,577
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

925
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:02,377
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,

926
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:04,277
"Monsieur Boyardee."

927
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:05,377
Touch?

928
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:08,877
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

929
01:07:09,077 --> 01:07:11,977
- The last word.
- Yes.

930
01:07:12,077 --> 01:07:14,377
Then tell me, Ambrister,

931
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:19,277
how could it be popular?

932
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:24,777
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

933
01:07:24,877 --> 01:07:27,977
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.

934
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,377
He is Gusteau's son.

935
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:33,377
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

936
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:34,777
The boy knows!

937
01:07:34,877 --> 01:07:37,877
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.

938
01:07:37,977 --> 01:07:42,377
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

939
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:44,977
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

940
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:47,077
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

941
01:07:47,177 --> 01:07:48,877
Yes. He's consorting with it.

942
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:51,477
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.

943
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:54,177
- The rat.
- Exactly!

944
01:07:55,477 --> 01:07:58,077
Is the rat important?

945
01:07:58,277 --> 01:08:01,477
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

946
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,877
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

947
01:08:03,977 --> 01:08:06,677
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

948
01:08:06,777 --> 01:08:09,277
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.

949
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:11,177
Ooh!

950
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:13,377
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

951
01:08:13,477 --> 01:08:16,677
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

952
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:17,877
But, oh, no!

953
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:22,277
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...

954
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:30,977
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

955
01:08:38,077 --> 01:08:39,077
Huh?

956
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,777
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

957
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,277
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.

958
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,777
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.

959
01:08:57,877 --> 01:08:59,577
What are you so worried about?

960
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:00,877
Isn't it good to have the press?

961
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:03,577
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?

962
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,077
Not if they're over his face!

963
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:10,277
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

964
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:15,377
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

965
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:17,477
The deadline passes in three days.

966
01:09:17,577 --> 01:09:20,477
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable

967
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,677
and no one will ever know.

968
01:09:23,277 --> 01:09:25,677
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.

969
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:28,277
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

970
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:32,877
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

971
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:39,777
- No, no, no.
- LINGUINl: What?

972
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:42,177
Try this. It's better.

973
01:09:56,277 --> 01:09:58,377
Well, because you...

974
01:09:59,477 --> 01:10:00,477
Whoa!

975
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:23,677
Rat!

976
01:10:30,177 --> 01:10:32,377
Disgusting little creatures.

977
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:45,277
I was reminded
how fragile it all was.

978
01:10:46,177 --> 01:10:48,277
How the world really saw me.

979
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:53,077
And it just kept getting better.

980
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:53,777
Remy!

981
01:10:53,777 --> 01:10:54,677
Remy!

982
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,077
Psst! Psst!

983
01:10:58,277 --> 01:11:00,677
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

984
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:04,377
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.

985
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:08,377
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

986
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,377
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!

987
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:13,277
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

988
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:14,477
I didn't think you meant them.

989
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:16,677
Look, I'm sorry.

990
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:19,177
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.

991
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:23,877
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

992
01:11:23,977 --> 01:11:25,277
Wait here.

993
01:11:31,177 --> 01:11:32,377
It's locked?

994
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:34,877
Hmm...

995
01:11:39,477 --> 01:11:41,277
Remy, what are you doing in here?

996
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:44,177
Okay. Emile shows up with...

997
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:48,177
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

998
01:11:48,377 --> 01:11:50,477
Yeah, it's a disaster.

999
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:54,177
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

1000
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:58,177
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1001
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:58,477
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1002
01:11:58,577 --> 01:12:02,377
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

1003
01:12:02,477 --> 01:12:05,177
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

1004
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:07,277
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?

1005
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:08,477
Or microwave burritos?

1006
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,677
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

1007
01:12:10,777 --> 01:12:12,477
About as French as a corn dog!

1008
01:12:12,777 --> 01:12:13,777
Coming soon!

1009
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:15,777
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.

1010
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:17,477
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

1011
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:19,277
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.

1012
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,777
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

1013
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:26,877
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

1014
01:12:26,977 --> 01:12:30,277
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

1015
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:31,377
Here it is.

1016
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:34,077
Hey. Your will!

1017
01:12:34,177 --> 01:12:38,877
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

1018
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:42,877
Linguini?

1019
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:46,477
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?

1020
01:12:46,577 --> 01:12:48,377
This used to be my office.

1021
01:13:11,677 --> 01:13:13,177
He's your son?

1022
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:16,077
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

1023
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:20,177
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

1024
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:21,177
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1025
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:24,077
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!

1026
01:13:25,477 --> 01:13:27,077
No! No! The rat!

1027
01:13:33,177 --> 01:13:35,977
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

1028
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,477
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!

1029
01:15:12,777 --> 01:15:14,377
You!

1030
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:19,177
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1031
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:24,377
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1032
01:15:26,977 --> 01:15:28,177
Cheers, ja.

1033
01:16:35,477 --> 01:16:37,777
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!

1034
01:16:38,977 --> 01:16:41,977
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1035
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:43,577
What is the secret to your genius?

1036
01:16:43,677 --> 01:16:47,277
LINGUINl: Secret? You want the truth?

1037
01:16:47,977 --> 01:16:53,377
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1038
01:16:53,477 --> 01:16:55,877
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.

1039
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:56,877
No.

1040
01:16:56,977 --> 01:16:59,777
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1041
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:01,377
How did you find out?

1042
01:17:01,477 --> 01:17:04,777
Well, some part of me just knew.

1043
01:17:05,277 --> 01:17:06,577
The Gusteau part?

1044
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:12,677
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1045
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:15,477
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1046
01:17:17,077 --> 01:17:19,177
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1047
01:17:22,677 --> 01:17:23,977
Health Inspector.

1048
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:26,677
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1049
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:27,977
It's taken over my...

1050
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,477
Gusteau's restaurant.

1051
01:17:30,577 --> 01:17:31,677
Gusteau's, eh?

1052
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:35,977
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1053
01:17:36,077 --> 01:17:38,177
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!

1054
01:17:38,277 --> 01:17:41,077
Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.

1055
01:17:41,177 --> 01:17:43,277
But the rat!
You must...

1056
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,877
It stole my documents.

1057
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:49,677
It's past opening time.

1058
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:52,177
He should have
finished an hour ago.

1059
01:17:54,077 --> 01:17:56,377
Bonjour, ma ch閞ie.
Join us.

1060
01:17:56,477 --> 01:17:58,577
We were just talking
about my inspiration.

1061
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:01,077
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1062
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,777
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1063
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,077
- It's him.
- Ego?

1064
01:18:09,177 --> 01:18:10,177
Anton Ego!

1065
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:11,677
Is that Ego?

1066
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:13,877
I can't believe it.

1067
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:17,277
- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.

1068
01:18:17,377 --> 01:18:21,877
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,

1069
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:25,677
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance

1070
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:27,977
as you are new to this game.

1071
01:18:29,277 --> 01:18:30,477
- Game?
- Yes.

1072
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:33,677
And you've been playing
without an opponent.

1073
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:38,877
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.

1074
01:18:39,077 --> 01:18:41,177
You're Anton Ego.

1075
01:18:42,777 --> 01:18:45,677
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.

1076
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:50,277
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.

1077
01:18:53,877 --> 01:18:57,877
I don't like food. I love it.

1078
01:18:58,277 --> 01:19:02,577
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1079
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:07,877
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.

1080
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:11,077
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1081
01:19:18,377 --> 01:19:21,877
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1082
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:25,077
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1083
01:19:26,977 --> 01:19:28,477
Don't give me that look.

1084
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:30,777
You were distracting me
in front of the press.

1085
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:35,377
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1086
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:36,677
And that's another thing.

1087
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,677
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.

1088
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,377
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.

1089
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:43,977
All right, that's it!

1090
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:49,877
You take a break, Little Chef.

1091
01:19:49,977 --> 01:19:51,177
I'm not your puppet,

1092
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:54,377
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1093
01:19:54,477 --> 01:19:56,277
The rat is the cook.

1094
01:19:56,377 --> 01:19:57,077
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1095
01:19:57,077 --> 01:19:59,277
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.

1096
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,377
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1097
01:20:05,477 --> 01:20:06,877
You stupid...

1098
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:12,577
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1099
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:15,977
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.

1100
01:20:17,477 --> 01:20:18,977
I'm sorry, Remy.

1101
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:20,077
I know there are too many guys.

1102
01:20:20,177 --> 01:20:21,177
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1103
01:20:21,277 --> 01:20:23,077
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1104
01:20:23,177 --> 01:20:25,277
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1105
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:28,277
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1106
01:20:28,477 --> 01:20:29,577
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1107
01:20:29,677 --> 01:20:32,077
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1108
01:20:33,677 --> 01:20:35,177
Little Chef?

1109
01:20:44,677 --> 01:20:49,477
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1110
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:10,177
Oof!

1111
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:27,777
Little Chef?

1112
01:21:28,577 --> 01:21:29,777
Little Chef?

1113
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:32,177
Hey, Little Chef.

1114
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:35,577
I thought you went back
to the apartment.

1115
01:21:35,777 --> 01:21:39,877
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...

1116
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:44,277
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1117
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:47,177
Look, I don't want to fight.

1118
01:21:47,377 --> 01:21:50,077
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.

1119
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:53,577
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?

1120
01:21:53,677 --> 01:21:54,977
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1121
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,977
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1122
01:21:58,177 --> 01:21:59,777
people will be disappointed.

1123
01:22:00,177 --> 01:22:01,777
It's weird.

1124
01:22:01,877 --> 01:22:04,777
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,

1125
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:07,677
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.

1126
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:10,577
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now

1127
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,877
is because of you.

1128
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:16,177
I haven't been fair to you.

1129
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:19,777
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.

1130
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,677
You've been a good friend.

1131
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:24,877
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...

1132
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,177
What is this?

1133
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,277
What's going on?

1134
01:22:32,777 --> 01:22:33,777
What...

1135
01:22:33,877 --> 01:22:34,777
Hey...

1136
01:22:35,377 --> 01:22:36,677
You're...

1137
01:22:36,777 --> 01:22:39,877
You're stealing food? How could you?

1138
01:22:39,977 --> 01:22:43,077
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1139
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:45,577
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1140
01:22:45,677 --> 01:22:47,077
And don't come back

1141
01:22:47,177 --> 01:22:50,577
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1142
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:01,977
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1143
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:05,977
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1144
01:23:07,377 --> 01:23:11,177
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.

1145
01:23:11,677 --> 01:23:13,077
Steal all you want.

1146
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:16,077
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1147
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:33,177
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1148
01:23:33,277 --> 01:23:38,077
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1149
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:44,977
Come in!

1150
01:23:45,177 --> 01:23:48,377
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1151
01:23:48,577 --> 01:23:52,377
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1152
01:23:55,777 --> 01:23:57,177
Attention.

1153
01:23:57,377 --> 01:24:00,077
Attention, everyone.

1154
01:24:00,277 --> 01:24:02,477
Tonight is a big night.

1155
01:24:02,677 --> 01:24:06,577
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.

1156
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:10,777
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1157
01:24:11,477 --> 01:24:14,377
And he's going to order something.

1158
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:17,077
Something from our menu.

1159
01:24:17,777 --> 01:24:21,877
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1160
01:24:21,977 --> 01:24:23,777
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?

1161
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:27,577
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1162
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:28,877
I'm hungry!

1163
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:31,677
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1164
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:34,777
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1165
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:37,277
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1166
01:24:38,877 --> 01:24:42,777
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1167
01:24:45,277 --> 01:24:51,577
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1168
01:24:51,977 --> 01:24:55,177
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.

1169
01:24:55,377 --> 01:24:57,777
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1170
01:24:58,077 --> 01:25:01,777
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1171
01:25:01,877 --> 01:25:04,677
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1172
01:25:06,677 --> 01:25:10,777
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1173
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:12,777
Yeah! Let's...

1174
01:25:13,177 --> 01:25:14,377
Okay.

1175
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:18,777
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.

1176
01:25:18,977 --> 01:25:22,977
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1177
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:26,877
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1178
01:25:30,677 --> 01:25:33,777
Au revoir, rat!

1179
01:25:41,077 --> 01:25:43,677
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?

1180
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,377
Yes, I think I do.

1181
01:25:45,877 --> 01:25:49,977
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1182
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:52,177
you know what I'm craving?

1183
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:56,477
A little perspective.

1184
01:25:56,677 --> 01:26:01,777
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1185
01:26:01,877 --> 01:26:04,677
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?

1186
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:09,677
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1187
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:10,977
I am...

1188
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:14,877
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1189
01:26:14,977 --> 01:26:18,277
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,

1190
01:26:18,377 --> 01:26:19,977
I'll make you a deal.

1191
01:26:20,077 --> 01:26:24,177
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.

1192
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:28,277
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1193
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:30,177
I'm afraid I...

1194
01:26:31,877 --> 01:26:34,277
Your dinner selection?

1195
01:26:34,977 --> 01:26:39,777
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1196
01:26:39,877 --> 01:26:43,277
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1197
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,977
I will have whatever he is having.

1198
01:26:56,777 --> 01:27:00,277
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1199
01:27:00,477 --> 01:27:03,477
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1200
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,577
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.

1201
01:27:06,777 --> 01:27:10,577
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1202
01:27:10,977 --> 01:27:13,277
You are free.

1203
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:16,877
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.

1204
01:27:16,977 --> 01:27:18,277
As you are.

1205
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:22,977
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1206
01:27:23,077 --> 01:27:25,477
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.

1207
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:28,277
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!

1208
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:30,377
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1209
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:33,477
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1210
01:27:33,577 --> 01:27:35,577
Why do I need to pretend?

1211
01:27:37,677 --> 01:27:39,277
But you don't, Remy.

1212
01:27:40,077 --> 01:27:41,677
You never did.

1213
01:27:50,677 --> 01:27:52,677
No. My other left!

1214
01:27:52,877 --> 01:27:54,677
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1215
01:27:54,877 --> 01:27:57,177
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1216
01:27:57,477 --> 01:27:58,477
Dad!

1217
01:27:59,077 --> 01:28:01,677
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1218
01:28:05,177 --> 01:28:07,277
I love you guys!

1219
01:28:09,277 --> 01:28:10,377
Where are you going?

1220
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:12,977
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1221
01:28:13,077 --> 01:28:16,677
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1222
01:28:24,377 --> 01:28:26,177
It's your recipe.

1223
01:28:26,277 --> 01:28:28,377
How can you not know
your own recipe?

1224
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:31,377
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1225
01:28:31,477 --> 01:28:34,577
Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!

1226
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:35,677
Where's my order?

1227
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,177
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1228
01:28:38,277 --> 01:28:39,277
This is what they're ordering.

1229
01:28:39,377 --> 01:28:41,777
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1230
01:28:41,877 --> 01:28:43,577
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1231
01:28:43,677 --> 01:28:46,677
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1232
01:28:46,777 --> 01:28:48,877
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1233
01:28:48,977 --> 01:28:50,377
I don't know what I did.

1234
01:28:50,477 --> 01:28:52,177
We need to tell
the customers something.

1235
01:28:52,277 --> 01:28:54,177
Then tell them... Tell them...

1236
01:28:58,277 --> 01:28:59,477
Huh?

1237
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:02,677
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1238
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,777
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1239
01:29:04,877 --> 01:29:08,877
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1240
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,277
Rats!

1241
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:13,577
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1242
01:29:14,077 --> 01:29:15,677
Don't touch him!

1243
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:20,377
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1244
01:29:21,677 --> 01:29:23,977
I know this sounds insane, but...

1245
01:29:24,077 --> 01:29:26,677
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1246
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:28,577
But that doesn't mean it's not

1247
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:30,877
the truth.

1248
01:29:31,577 --> 01:29:35,777
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1249
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:40,477
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.

1250
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:45,677
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1251
01:29:45,977 --> 01:29:47,977
He's been controlling my actions.

1252
01:29:49,977 --> 01:29:53,577
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1253
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:56,877
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1254
01:29:57,177 --> 01:29:59,877
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.

1255
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:01,777
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1256
01:30:01,877 --> 01:30:04,877
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?

1257
01:30:06,577 --> 01:30:10,777
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1258
01:30:11,277 --> 01:30:13,677
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1259
01:30:13,777 --> 01:30:19,277
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1260
01:30:19,977 --> 01:30:22,377
What do you say? You with me?

1261
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:11,377
Dad.

1262
01:32:15,477 --> 01:32:18,377
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1263
01:32:18,577 --> 01:32:22,677
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.

1264
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:26,877
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.

1265
01:32:27,077 --> 01:32:29,877
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.

1266
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:33,777
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1267
01:32:34,477 --> 01:32:36,877
This really means that much to you?

1268
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:47,877
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1269
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:51,077
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.

1270
01:32:59,077 --> 01:33:02,677
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1271
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,077
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1272
01:33:28,177 --> 01:33:29,977
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1273
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:31,677
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1274
01:33:31,877 --> 01:33:37,277
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1275
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:40,077
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.

1276
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:51,777
We need someone to wait tables.

1277
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:10,077
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.

1278
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,477
Please, take all of the time you need.

1279
01:34:15,577 --> 01:34:18,177
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...

1280
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:24,877
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.

1281
01:34:24,977 --> 01:34:27,277
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1282
01:34:27,377 --> 01:34:30,877
Easy with that sole meuni鑢e.
Less salt. More butter.

1283
01:34:31,177 --> 01:34:33,077
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1284
01:34:33,177 --> 01:34:36,777
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1285
01:34:36,977 --> 01:34:39,677
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade compos閑.

1286
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:42,877
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1287
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:47,177
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1288
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,677
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1289
01:34:49,877 --> 01:34:52,777
Don't boil the consomm?
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1290
01:34:52,877 --> 01:34:53,977
Sorry.

1291
01:34:57,677 --> 01:34:59,777
Colette, wait! Colette.

1292
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:04,277
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1293
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:05,877
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.

1294
01:35:06,077 --> 01:35:08,477
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1295
01:35:11,577 --> 01:35:14,077
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1296
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:17,177
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?

1297
01:35:35,677 --> 01:35:37,577
What? I am making ratatouille.

1298
01:35:38,777 --> 01:35:41,177
Well, how would you prepare it?

1299
01:36:13,277 --> 01:36:16,377
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1300
01:37:02,477 --> 01:37:03,777
Mmm.

1301
01:37:07,277 --> 01:37:09,077
No, it can't be.

1302
01:37:09,677 --> 01:37:13,277
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1303
01:37:20,277 --> 01:37:21,977
I can't remember the last time

1304
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:25,377
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.

1305
01:37:26,277 --> 01:37:29,077
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position

1306
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,277
of having my waiter be the chef.

1307
01:37:31,477 --> 01:37:34,477
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1308
01:37:35,477 --> 01:37:37,977
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1309
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:40,577
Excuse me a minute.

1310
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:52,577
You must be the chef...

1311
01:37:52,677 --> 01:37:54,777
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait

1312
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:56,977
until all the other customer have gone.

1313
01:37:58,977 --> 01:38:00,177
So be it.

1314
01:38:21,877 --> 01:38:24,377
At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.

1315
01:38:24,577 --> 01:38:30,577
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.

1316
01:38:36,177 --> 01:38:40,177
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.

1317
01:38:40,777 --> 01:38:45,077
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...

1318
01:38:45,177 --> 01:38:46,877
Thank you for the meal.

1319
01:38:46,977 --> 01:38:49,877
... and leaves without another word.

1320
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:56,077
The following day his review appears.

1321
01:38:58,577 --> 01:39:02,677
In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1322
01:39:02,877 --> 01:39:07,177
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1323
01:39:07,277 --> 01:39:11,277
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1324
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:16,877
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1325
01:39:17,477 --> 01:39:23,977
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1326
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:28,077
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1327
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:31,477
than our criticism designating it so.

1328
01:39:31,877 --> 01:39:35,977
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1329
01:39:36,077 --> 01:39:40,377
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1330
01:39:40,477 --> 01:39:45,077
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1331
01:39:45,277 --> 01:39:47,777
The new needs friends.

1332
01:39:48,077 --> 01:39:51,577
Last night,
I experienced something new,

1333
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:56,777
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1334
01:39:56,977 --> 01:39:59,577
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1335
01:39:59,677 --> 01:40:03,177
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1336
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:05,977
is a gross understatement.

1337
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:09,577
They have rocked me to my core.

1338
01:40:10,377 --> 01:40:13,777
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain

1339
01:40:13,877 --> 01:40:18,877
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1340
01:40:19,177 --> 01:40:25,377
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.

1341
01:40:25,677 --> 01:40:29,577
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1342
01:40:29,777 --> 01:40:34,077
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1343
01:40:34,677 --> 01:40:37,977
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1344
01:40:38,077 --> 01:40:41,877
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1345
01:40:41,977 --> 01:40:44,877
who is, in this critic's opinion,

1346
01:40:44,977 --> 01:40:49,177
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1347
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,277
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1348
01:40:51,277 --> 01:40:54,677
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.

1349
01:40:55,077 --> 01:40:56,577
It was a great night.

1350
01:40:56,677 --> 01:40:58,477
The happiest of my life.

1351
01:40:58,577 --> 01:41:03,077
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.

1352
01:41:03,177 --> 01:41:06,377
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,

1353
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:08,877
and of course they ratted us out.

1354
01:41:09,277 --> 01:41:10,877
The food didn't matter.

1355
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:13,377
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,

1356
01:41:13,477 --> 01:41:15,477
oh, man, the restaurant was closed

1357
01:41:15,577 --> 01:41:18,377
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1358
01:41:18,477 --> 01:41:20,377
But don't feel too bad for him.

1359
01:41:20,477 --> 01:41:23,977
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.

1360
01:41:24,277 --> 01:41:26,877
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

1361
01:41:35,077 --> 01:41:37,177
Got to go. Dinner rush.

1362
01:41:44,777 --> 01:41:46,477
You know how he likes it.

1363
01:41:51,777 --> 01:41:53,377
Thanks, Little Chef.

1364
01:42:00,077 --> 01:42:02,877
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1365
01:42:02,977 --> 01:42:06,177
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?

1366
01:42:07,277 --> 01:42:09,077
Surprise me.

1367
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:17,977
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?

1368
01:42:21,477 --> 01:42:25,077
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?

1369
01:42:26,977 --> 01:42:30,077
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
